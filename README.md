# Face_mask_detection

1) Used labelEncoder to convert the category labels to numerals and performed preprocessing of the test dataset using MTCNN library in python to identify and bound faces with        boxes

2) Trained a feature extractor using CNN with 3 hidden layers using the reLU activation function and then paired with 2 dense layers using reLU and sigmoid functions for final        predictions

3) Applied Adam optimizer on the model to increase accuracy by 6%, obtaining 92% training accuracy and 93% validation accuracy on the kaggle face_mask_detection dataset
